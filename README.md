# mcmc4 package

This package creates S4 classes which store Markov Chain Monte Carlo
simulations from the **coda** package, `mcmc`, `mcmc.list` and
`summary.mcmc`, as well as a few generic functions. By defining S4
classes it is easier to inherit from these classes in order to build
in specific behavior for models.
